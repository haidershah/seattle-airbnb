# Run data analysis on Airbnb's open data on Seattle listings

## Installation
You need Anaconda's distribution of Python to run this. The version of Python I've used is 3. In order to run the analysis you'll need to download the data first from: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle. Make sure to save all the files in a folder called 'seattle', which should be a sibling to the the Notebook.

## Project Motivation
I ran data analysis on Airbnb's open data on Seattle listings by answering 3 questions:
1. Are hosts who have a high review score rating charging renters more?
2. What are the pricing trends in Seattle?
3. What are the 3 most expensive and least expensive neighborhoods in Seattle for renting?

## File Descriptions
There's 1 Jupyter Notebook in this project which has all the code and analysis.

## Results
I've answered these questions in the provided Jupyter Notebook and in a Blog Post at: https://medium.com/@rameez.shah/do-airbnb-reviews-have-a-price-tag-b1d08118086d
