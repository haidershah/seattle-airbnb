# Run data analysis on Airbnb's open data on Seattle listings

I ran a data analysis on Airbnb's open data on Seattle listings by asking 3 questions:
1. Are hosts who have a high review score rating charging renters more?
2. What are the pricing trends in Seattle?
3.What are the 3 most expensive and least expensive neighborhoods in Seattle for renting?

## How to run the Jupyter Notebook
- In order to run Jupyter Notebook you'll need to download the data first: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle.
- Save all the files in a folder called 'seattle'.
- Make sure that the folder is a sibling to the the Notebook.
